 Patient Management System â€“ Unit Testing Project

This project is a simplified patient management system built in Java, primarily designed to practice writing and organizing unit test cases using JUnit. The core logic is implemented in the `PatientManagementSystem` class, and the entire testing process is coordinated using a central `TestSuitRunner`.

 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience in **writing clean, modular, and comprehensive unit tests** to verify and validate the behavior of individual components in a Java-based system. It focuses on improving software reliability through test-driven thinking.

 Testing

- Framework: **JUnit**
- Test Runner: `TestSuitRunner.java`
- 30+ individual test classes written to cover different cases.

 Learning Outcomes

- Fundamentals of unit testing in Java  
- Writing modular and reusable test cases  
- Test coverage and behavior validation  
- Running multiple test classes with a centralized runner
